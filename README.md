# FinanceBot

FinanceBot is an educational, GenAI-assisted system for long-term investment analysis.
The project was developed as part of a Professional Research Project and is strictly
educational (not financial advice).

The repository reflects an iterative development process guided by analysis, advising,
designing, and realization phases. Commit history is used as evidence of incremental
implementation and refinement.

This repository represents the final implementation state used for assessment.
